1. What is the keyboard interaction missing
    The key board interaction is missing the ability for users to see the focusable element.
    This means that although the accordion headers are focusable and are part of the tab sequence, 
    users cannot see where the focus is. This unfortunately may cause some confusion with how to interact using the keyboard.


2. What is the ARIA missing
    The accordion header button is missing the aria-expanded = "true/false".
    The accordion header button is missing the aria-controls="ID".
    The accordion panel (div region) is missing the aria-labelledby="IDREF".
    The accordion panel is missing the "role" attribute.
